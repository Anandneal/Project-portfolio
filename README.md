this is my portfolio. it includes an about me, skills, portfolio and how to contact me
this project challanging for me because I want to add more things to my website, and looking through multiple different ways on how to add effects and hero tags it was a bit of overload. still also having issues with when to use flex correctly and started looking into grid and different ways to css to help me but it also looks like my code could be sloppy.
In the future I plan to improve my website by adding real projects. better animations, better alignment, better display effects and also an overall different aestheic to my portfolio
